# go_seamCarving
This script implements part of the "seam carving" algorithm by Avidan et al..

This script was designed as an assignment in the ComputerVision course in winter term 2017/18 at Westfälische-Wilhelms Universität Münster.
Due to time and scale restrictions the script only partially implements the algorithm. According to the assignment no external libraries were used in processing.
